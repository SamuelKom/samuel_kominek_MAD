# samuel_kominek_MAD DL_02
# !!!WARNING PLEASE READ!!!
Pushed only main kotlin file.
Didn't know if we need to push the whole project since in DL 01 only the kt file was needed.
The internet access as well as the dependencies in gradle were added to make this file work.
Since I already started working on DL 03 after upload, I don't have the old state of the project to be pushed as a whole.
I hope it is okay, if needed you can see the dependencies and adjustments for DL 02 in the respective files in the DL 03 branch commit.
